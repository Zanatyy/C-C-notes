# Vector Data Structure

Simply, Arrays has a static size. In older versions you can't change the size of an array during runtime. Vector is an idea of implementing a dynamic array. An array that can change its size during runtime and in addition to attributes that makes it a good replacement to an Array if needed.

## Vector consists of:
-Array.
-Size and Capacity Variables.
-Member Functions.

Vector Constructor will take the size of the array as an input.

## Functions:
- void set(int p,int x).
-int get(int p).
-void expand_capacity().

-void push_back(int x)

-int get_size()

-void printv()

-void insertion(int x,int p)
